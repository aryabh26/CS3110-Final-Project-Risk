  Our project is to rebuild the classic board game RISK. It supports between 2-6 
  players and allows players to place troops, move troops, and attack other 
  players. The interface is designed to mimic the game board, with numbers and 
  colors in each territory to indicate which player owns that space and how many 
  troops there are.
